Professor : Byunghan Lee<br /><br />

## Course Outline
Introduces the concept and application of machine learning, which is the core of artificial intelligence, and learns about major machine learning algorithms and models. Main contents include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, cluster algorithms, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, hidden Markov models, collaborative filtering, graphical models, and the basics of deep learning.

## Educational Goals
It focuses on understanding the basic concepts and principles of pattern recognition and machine learning.

## 1. GD_and_SGD.ipynb
Make a logistic regression model using Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent<br />
- requirement: Use NumPy NOT any other APIs<br /> 

## 2. LeNet_5_model.ipynb
Make a MLP model to learn Fashion-MNIST data set<br />
- requirements:<br />
  - you should use TensorFlow (v1.15) NOT Keras<br />
  - the model have to achieve classification accuracy >= 0.87<br />

## 3. Multi_Layer_perceptron.ipynb
Make a LeNet-5 model to learn MNIST data set<br />
- requirements:<br />
  - Use TensorFlow (v1.15) NOT Keras<br />
  - Model Should achieve classification accuracy of 0.99<br />
